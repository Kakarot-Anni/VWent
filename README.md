## Around 900 Million people admit that they have somehow suffered from mental disorders in some point of their life.

## Why Mental Health
* Improved overall well-being: Taking care of your mental health can lead to improved emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. When your mental health is in good shape, you may feel more energized, positive, and productive.

* Reduced stress: Prioritizing your mental health can help reduce stress levels. Chronic stress can have negative effects on physical health, such as increasing the risk of heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.

* Better relationships: Good mental health can help improve relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. When you're in a good mental space, you may be more patient, understanding, and empathetic towards others.

* Increased self-awareness: Prioritizing your mental health can help you develop a greater sense of self-awareness. This can help you better understand your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, which can lead to personal growth and improved decision-making.

* Improved work performance: Good mental health can lead to improved work performance, as it can enhance your focus, productivity, and creativity.

* Enhanced resilience: Taking care of your mental health can help you build resilience to life's challenges. This can help you cope with stress, setbacks, and difficult situations.

* Reduced stigma: By prioritizing mental health, individuals can help reduce the stigma around mental health issues. This can help encourage others to seek help and support when they need it.

* Improved quality of life: Ultimately, taking care of your mental health can lead to an improved overall quality of life. It can help you feel happier, more fulfilled, and more connected to the world around you.

## If this is such a big issue then why are no prior solutions?
* Stigma and Shame: Mental health issues are often stigmatized and associated with shame, which can lead people to feel embarrassed or ashamed to seek help.

* Lack of Understanding: Many people may not fully understand mental health issues and their impact, which can lead them to overlook the importance of addressing them.

* Belief in Self-Reliance: Some people may believe that mental health issues are something that can be overcome through willpower and personal strength, leading them to ignore the need for professional help.

* Fear of Being Judged: People may worry about being judged or seen as weak if they admit to struggling with mental health issues, leading them to avoid seeking help.

* Financial Constraints: Access to mental health care can be expensive and not covered by insurance, leading people to prioritize other expenses over their mental health.

* Cultural and Religious Beliefs: Cultural or religious beliefs may view mental health issues as a weakness or punishment, leading individuals to ignore their mental health concerns.

* Lack of Resources: Some people may not have access to mental health care resources or information, which can limit their ability to seek help.

* Prioritizing Physical Health: Many people prioritize physical health over mental health, leading them to overlook mental health concerns.

* Lack of Time: Busy schedules and the demands of daily life can make it difficult for people to prioritize their mental health and seek help.

* Fear of Diagnosis: Some people may fear receiving a mental health diagnosis, which can lead them to avoid seeking help or ignore their symptoms.



## VWent is a an application which focusses on "Mental Health".

As the name suggests "VWent" is a cute wordplay Vent and Went, we give users both the choices of "Vent" and "Went out".

We have divided our application into 3 basic buttons.
| Button:   | Dedicated to:                |
| :-------- | :------------------------- |
| The Fighters | This section is dedicated to people who are currently fighting their mental health situations |
| The Winners| This section is dedicated to people who have fought their devils are are ready to help the fighters|
| The Helpers| This section is dedicated to NGOs or specialists who work for Mental Health, for exper advice|


## The Fighters
The fighters are basically a set of people who are facing mental health issues:
* Stigma: Mental health conditions are often stigmatized or misunderstood, and people may fear judgment or discrimination if they disclose that they are struggling. They may worry that others will view them as weak, crazy, or unable to handle their emotions.

* Shame or guilt: Related to stigma, some people may feel ashamed or guilty about their mental health struggles, as if they have somehow caused or brought them on themselves. This can make it difficult to talk about or seek help.

* Fear of consequences: In some situations, disclosing a mental health condition could have negative consequences, such as losing a job, being ostracized by friends or family, or facing legal or institutional repercussions. People may weigh these potential risks against the benefits of being open about their mental health.

* Lack of knowledge or resources: Some people may not even realize that they have a mental health condition, or may not know where to turn for help. They may feel overwhelmed by the prospect of navigating the healthcare system or finding a therapist, and thus may choose to stay silent out of sheer confusion or frustration.

* Cultural or religious beliefs: In some cultures or religions, mental health issues may be viewed as taboo or as a sign of weakness. People may worry about going against these norms or beliefs if they disclose their struggles.

* Previous negative experiences: If someone has previously disclosed their mental health struggles and been met with negative reactions or unhelpful responses, they may be hesitant to try again. They may fear being dismissed, invalidated, or ignored.

* Personal choice: Finally, it's worth noting that some people simply prefer to keep their mental health private. They may feel that they can manage their symptoms on their own, or that they don't want to burden others with their problems. While it's important to encourage people to seek help when needed, it's also important to respect their autonomy and choices. 


## The Winners
Mental health issues can be incredibly challenging, and they can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, or background. However, it's important to remember that recovery is possible, and many people who have struggled with mental health issues have gone on to lead happy and fulfilling lives.

One example of someone who has won from their mental health issues is author and mental health advocate, Matt Haig. Haig struggled with depression and anxiety for many years and even attempted suicide at one point. However, through therapy and medication, he was able to manage his symptoms and eventually overcome his mental health challenges.

Haig has since written several books about his experiences with mental illness, including "Reasons to Stay Alive" and "Notes on a Nervous Planet." He has also become a vocal advocate for mental health awareness, and his work has helped to break down stigma and promote understanding of mental health issues.

Another example is Demi Lovato, who has been open about her struggles with addiction, bipolar disorder, and an eating disorder. Lovato has used her platform as a celebrity to raise awareness about mental health and has been an advocate for mental health treatment and support.

Through therapy, medication, and other forms of treatment, Lovato has been able to manage her mental health challenges and has gone on to release several successful albums and continue her acting career.

These are just two examples of many people who have won from their mental health issues and are now leading happy and fulfilling lives. While recovery can be a challenging and ongoing process, it's important to remember that there is always hope for a brighter future.

## The Helpers

NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) and therapists play an essential role in promoting mental health and providing support to those who are struggling with mental health issues.

NGOs that focus on mental health aim to raise awareness about mental health issues, reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness, and provide education and support to those affected by mental health problems. These organizations often work to advocate for better mental health policies and access to mental health care.

Therapists, on the other hand, work directly with individuals to help them manage and overcome mental health challenges. They use various therapeutic techniques to provide support and guidance to individuals struggling with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, trauma, and addiction.

NGOs and therapists often work in collaboration to provide comprehensive mental health support to individuals and communities. NGOs can refer individuals to therapists for specialized care, and therapists can refer individuals to NGOs for additional support and resources.

Together, NGOs and therapists can help to reduce the negative impact of mental health problems on individuals and communities, and promote mental wellness for all.

  
## The Working:
#### How does the APPLICATION work?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103282903/225742458-bf8a3927-2e99-4c66-af80-d6bd610efc09.png)

* The Person who is a fighter is first asked if he wishes to stay anonymous.
* If he wishes to stays anonymous, he gets asked the porblems which are faced by him directly, If not, he is asked to fill in some basic details.
* He gets a checkbox list and explains his problem.

* On the other hand if the person logs in as a winner, he/she is also asked if he wishes to stay anonymous.
* If he wishes to stay anonymous, he's asked what problems he faced and how did he conquer them directly, If not, he's asked to fill in some basic details.
* He gets a checkbox list and explains his problem.
![The Fighters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103282903/225749239-abd21a4a-3b5a-4966-af70-762a7e900856.png)

#### We are basically establishing the link between the people who are facing the issues and those who have already faced the issues and are willing to help.

* In case there is a person who is not able to connect to a person who has faced a similar problem before, and the bad luck is so bad that he's facing a totally new problem, the helpers come in handy here, they're going to help them. (Basically verfied mental health care problems and therapists)
* The helpers can also help the fighters in case the winners' solution isn't handy for them.

## Went out

#### For "went out" the following is the workflow:

* If the person is lonely and wishes to meet new people outside physically, then we wish to provide them with the dating app scenrio but not really a date.
* There is a condition that if the two people wish to meet physically through our application they will have to do the KYC process.
* They can meet share problems, solutions, go for a movie, and enjoy a liesure time together.
